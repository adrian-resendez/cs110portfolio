                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p>As a soon-to-be graduate from the University of California Riverside (UCR) in June 2024, with a major in Computer Science, I am at the threshold of an exciting journey into the expansive world of computer science and software engineering. Holding dual citizenship in Mexico and the United States, I bring a unique perspective and diverse skill set to the table.</p>
                <p>My academic and project experiences have allowed me to delve deeply into various domains including full-stack web and mobile application development, databases, machine learning, both small and large-scale natural language processing, web development, embedded systems, and cyber security.</p>
                <p>I am contemplating two paths forward: furthering my education through a B.S.M.S. (master's program) in computer science to enrich my research capabilities or diving straight into the workforce to apply my skills in a practical setting. Whichever path I choose, I am eager to make a significant impact in the field of computer science and software engineering.</p>
