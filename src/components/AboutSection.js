      As a native Spanish speaker, fluent in English, I bring a unique multicultural perspective to my work, which enhances my ability to collaborate in diverse teams and approach problems with a global mindset.
    </p>
    <p>
      My academic journey is complemented by hands-on experience in projects ranging from developing scalable web applications to optimizing data processing with GPU acceleration. I have also contributed to building secure and efficient software systems, demonstrating a keen understanding of security practices.
