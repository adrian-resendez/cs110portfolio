    <h2>Extracurriculars & Interests</h2>
    <p>I attend UCR's Rose Hack and Citrus Hackathons every year and participate in Codeforces rounds occasionally. For volunteer work, I volunteer at UCR's science fairs for kids at Chung Hall for the past 2 years. Additionally, I am looking to start after-school coding bootcamps for high school students, which is currently in the works.</p>
